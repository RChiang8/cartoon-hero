		<h2>About Vint</h2>
		<p>	When he was younger, his father worked at an aeronautics company, and his mother was a housewife. He usually takes apart some technology, like his mothers vacuum, and then he would fix it, sometimes adding an extra bolt or nut since he was curious about how thing worked. Vint attended Van Nuys High School, where Steve Crocker and Jon Postel, who were scientists, were classmates. He attended Stanford University where he obtained his bachelors degree in 1965 on the subject of mathematics. After that, he got employed at IBM, where the first personal computer was invented. He was in the position of a systems engineer. He was also in UCLA at the same time trying to get his masters degree in computer science. He then was chosen to work with Robert E. Kahn, an engineer already pursuing with the ARPANet network. Cerf was the senior members of the Network Measurement Center, which was made for ARPANet performance testing and analysis.
